## Target Audience
1. A general medley of business casual and blue collar/skilled groups
2. Internet fraternity/sorority related to business casual

## How it Operates
1. Goals and objective(i.e. exchange business cards) set by group representatives
- This is hard because the populations naturally don't want to mix

## Executing
1. Instead of basing on events (i.e. Meetup.com), base it on groups of people instead of individuals (i.e. Facebook)
2. Not everyone needs to have profile to join

## How it Generates Revenue
1. Promoting Groups instead of events
